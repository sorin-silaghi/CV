                                    Busymechines builds software products for third parties so I had the opportunity to work on a large number of projects for different customers.

                                    For most of my time with them, I worked as a technical lead for a start-up developing one-click taxi booking devices that are deployed across the world. My duties included reviewing requirements, establishing the software architecture and design, implementation of tasks that were too difficult for more junior developers, code review (Java, JavaScript, TypeScript), and mentoring junior developers. On the operations side, I was involved with server maintenance, support, bug fixing, and addressing performance issues. During my time on this project, we implemented integrations with more than 70 different taxi companies and taxi dispatcher platforms, developed and deployed new products, greatly improved the monitoring system of both our infrastructure and the devices themselves, and migrated to a cloud based solution using Docker deployed in AWS.

                                    During my time at Busymachines I was also involved in other projects: evaluating and quoting potential new customers, doing technical research and proposing solutions for new customers, worked as a mobile developer on an energy monitoring application, bug fixing and security fixes on both Java and Node.js backends, migrated PHP project to Docker.

                                    I was a contractor working on Android mobile applications and Node.js server applications. Most of the projects I worked on were minimum viable products that third parties contracted nearForm to develop. Some examples are mobile apps for a British bank, a security company, and a mobile payment startup.

                                    At EDIGrid I worked on developing an interchange system to convert and transmit documents between companies. I was the first developer on the project and then became the technical lead as the team grew. Because of this, I was responsible for making most of the early technical decisions that went into building the system.
