The most notable project I've worked on so far is a cloud solution for managing software updates and log files for medical devices. The main challenges in this project revolve around the large number of configurations possible for the medical devices as well as parsing a very large amount of log data in different formats, depending on device type.

                                    During this period I worked as a technical lead on a project developing taxi booking devices that are deployed across the world. My duties included reviewing requirements, establishing the software architecture and design, implementation of tasks that were too difficult for more junior developers, code review (Java, JavaScript, TypeScript), and mentoring junior developers. On the operations side, I was involved with server maintenance, support, bug fixing, and addressing performance issues.

                                    In my time on this project, we implemented integrations with more than 70 different taxi companies and taxi dispatcher platforms, developed and deployed new products, greatly improved the monitoring system of both our infrastructure and the devices themselves, and migrated to a cloud based solution using Docker deployed in AWS.
